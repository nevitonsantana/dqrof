# AletheIA Self-Application Loop

## Goal

This document explains how AletheIA should be used to improve AletheIA itself.

In simple terms:

the framework should not evolve only through ad-hoc repo edits.
It should increasingly apply its own operating logic to its own roadmap, changes, and learnings.

---

## Why this matters

Alpha 2 is not only about having real pilots.

It is also about proving that:

- the framework can guide its own evolution
- repository changes can follow the same discipline it recommends to others
- learnings from pilots can be converted into framework improvements without becoming anecdotal drift

Without a self-application loop, AletheIA risks becoming:

- a framework that describes discipline but does not use it
- a public repo that grows by intuition instead of explicit reasoning
- a pilot-driven project without a repeatable conversion path from learning to framework change

---

## Core idea

The self-application loop is:

`framework change -> task framing -> governance -> validation -> learning -> framework improvement`

This does not mean every small edit needs full ceremony.

It means meaningful framework evolution should increasingly leave behind:

- a reason
- a scope
- a validation
- a learning

---

## What should be self-applied first

Alpha 2 should start small.

The first things to self-apply are:

1. roadmap-driven framework changes
2. governance baseline improvements
3. pilot-to-framework conversions
4. changes that affect public positioning or adoption guidance

This is enough to prove the loop without turning every typo into process theater.

---

## Minimum self-application discipline

For a meaningful framework change, try to preserve:

### 1. A clear work item

What exactly is changing?

### 2. A bounded scope

What is inside this increment, and what is not?

### 3. A validation path

How do we know the change holds?

Examples:

- governance baseline passes
- tests still pass
- docs align with implementation

### 4. A durable learning

What should future framework work remember from this change?

---

## Relationship to pilots

Pilots are not only examples.

In Alpha 2, pilots should become input for framework evolution.

That means:

1. a pilot exposes a friction, gap, or useful pattern
2. the learning is written down
3. the repo evolves in a small explicit increment
4. the framework becomes slightly more reusable because of that pilot

This is the practical bridge between:

`real field use` and `public framework maturity`

---

## What self-application is not

Self-application is not:

- forcing every tiny change through heavy artifacts
- pretending the framework is already fully automated
- blocking momentum with unnecessary ceremony

It is a discipline of proportion.

The process should be heavy enough to preserve reasoning, but light enough to keep the project moving.

---

## Good Alpha 2 signs

Alpha 2 is going well when:

- a framework change can be traced back to a real pilot or explicit roadmap need
- the repo shows why something changed, not only that it changed
- the public narrative and the internal reasoning stay aligned
- the framework starts to improve itself with its own language

---

## First practical pattern

For now, the simplest useful self-application pattern is:

1. choose one small roadmap or pilot-driven improvement
2. open a clean branch
3. implement it with bounded scope
4. run the minimum baseline validation
5. record the learning
6. merge and keep `main` coherent

This is already enough to prove self-application in practice.

---

## What Alpha 2 should prove with this

By adding the self-application loop, AletheIA should show that:

- the framework can shape its own evolution
- pilot learnings can become reusable artifacts
- repo evolution can be governed without becoming rigid

---

## Future evolution

Later versions may connect self-application more directly to:

- explicit task briefs for framework work
- policy trace for repo evolution
- pilot-to-framework scorecards
- project extension patterns

Alpha 2 does not need all of that on day one.

It only needs to make the loop visible and repeatable.
