# Bootstrap Output Examples

## Goal

This document provides first future-facing examples of what safe Alpha 7 bootstrap outputs could look like.

In simple terms:

if AletheIA eventually generates setup outputs,
it helps to show a few examples of the output shape before any heavier tooling exists.

---

## Why this matters

Bootstrap principles define posture.
Delivery tooling boundaries define limits.

But teams also need examples of what a healthy output might look like when tooling stays inside those limits.

These examples are not generator contracts by themselves.
They are illustrative output shapes for what Alpha 7 should aim for if and when it emits files or packages.
A separate generator contract can later define the minimum input/output agreement behind those shapes.

---

## Output principle

A bootstrap output is healthy when:

- it reflects a model already defined in Alpha 6
- it remains inspectable and reviewable
- it makes its source assumptions visible
- it points back to canonical docs when meaning matters

A bootstrap output is unhealthy when:

- it hides what preset or mode influenced it
- it quietly redefines framework meaning
- it behaves like a black box install artifact
- it makes one surface canonical by default

---

## Example 1 — Lightweight repo onboarding package

### Input assumptions

- preset: Core Starter
- adoption mode: Lite
- delivery surface: repo-native

### Healthy output shape

A bootstrap helper might emit a small onboarding package such as:

- a short reading order
- a recommended first starter-pack subset
- a note that Alpha 4 and Alpha 5 layers are postponed unless justified
- explicit links back to canonical docs

### Why this is healthy

- the output is small and inspectable
- the preset and adoption mode remain visible
- the tooling is not inventing new framework meaning

---

## Example 2 — Existing project adoption package

### Input assumptions

- preset: Existing Project Adoption
- adoption mode: Standard
- delivery surface: repo or instruction package

### Healthy output shape

A bootstrap helper might emit:

- a short adoption checklist
- explicit links to `docs/apply-to-existing-project.md`
- the project extension template as a recommended artifact
- a note about what remains project-local versus framework-level

### Why this is healthy

- it packages existing guidance instead of replacing it
- it preserves the core versus extension boundary
- it remains readable without trusting the tool blindly

---

## Example 3 — Multi-agent continuity package

### Input assumptions

- preset: Multi-Agent Continuity
- adoption mode: Standard or Fuller
- delivery surface: instruction or handoff-oriented output

### Healthy output shape

A bootstrap helper might emit:

- a short handoff starter package
- references to the handoff template
- references to project handoff conventions
- a note that handoff structure remains model-agnostic

### Why this is healthy

- it packages the Alpha 4 baseline without rewriting it
- it keeps continuity explicit rather than hidden in memory
- it does not privilege one agent shell as the framework truth

---

## Example 4 — Risk-aware review package

### Input assumptions

- preset: Risk-Aware Delivery
- adoption mode: Fuller
- delivery surface: review-oriented

### Healthy output shape

A bootstrap helper might emit:

- a pointer to the inference artifact template
- a small trigger reminder for when inference is justified
- references to example artifacts
- a note that inference is selective, not universal ceremony

### Why this is healthy

- it preserves the conditional nature of Alpha 5
- it links the team back to reviewable canonical artifacts
- it avoids pretending to automate judgment itself

---

## Example 5 — Security-sensitive delivery package

### Input assumptions

- preset: Security-Sensitive
- adoption mode: Fuller
- delivery surface: repo or instruction package

### Healthy output shape

A bootstrap helper might emit:

- strong references to the governance baseline
- references to future domain governance packs as optional planned layers
- a warning that domain packs are not universal defaults
- a note that project-local security rules still require explicit human ownership

### Why this is healthy

- it keeps future packs in the right layer
- it does not silently install domain-specific truth as universal framework behavior
- it stays honest about what is planned versus what is active

---

## What these outputs should not become

These examples should not become:

- fixed generator contracts too early
- proof that Alpha 7 should automate everything
- replacement docs for the canonical repo surfaces
- a reason to blur preset, adapter, and adoption mode into one opaque command

They are examples of healthy output posture, not promises of final implementation.

---

## Good signs

Alpha 7 output examples are healthy when:

- each output stays traceable to preset, mode, and delivery surface
- generated material remains readable before adoption
- the outputs package the framework without redefining it
- the examples make future tooling safer rather than more magical
