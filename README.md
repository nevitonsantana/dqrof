# AletheIA

**AletheIA** is an operating framework for AI-assisted work.

It adds an explicit layer between model output and execution so teams can work with:

- clearer framing
- bounded execution
- reviewable decisions
- proportional validation
- reusable learnings

In short:

`model or agent output -> AletheIA -> governed action`

---

## What AletheIA is

AletheIA is:

- provider-agnostic
- reusable across projects
- focused on bounded, reviewable work
- designed to preserve continuity across agents, runtimes, and handoffs

## What AletheIA is not

AletheIA is not:

- a chatbot
- a single-runtime wrapper
- a hidden auto-router
- a substitute for project-local operating rules

---

## How AletheIA works

```mermaid

    A["Model or agent output"] --> B["Intent and context framing"]
    B --> C["Decision and governance"]
    C --> D["Bounded execution"]
    D --> E["Validation and review"]
    E --> F["Learnings and durable continuity"]
    F --> G["Governed action or restartable handoff"]
```

The framework helps teams move from:

`prompt -> output -> execution`

into:

`intent -> context -> decision -> execution -> validation -> learning`

That shift is the core value of AletheIA.

---

## What makes AletheIA different

AletheIA is not only a workflow-control layer.
It also provides:

- **Governed decisions** — the framework can help decide when work should continue, slow down, escalate, or require review
- **Context and token discipline** — context expansion is treated as something to justify, not something to do by reflex
- **Runtime and trust-boundary awareness** — hosted vs local posture, runtime fit, and operational boundaries are part of the model
- **Restartable continuity** — handoffs, restart packages, and finalization are designed to survive runtime changes without transcript replay
- **Validation before closure** — proof is part of the work, not an optional afterthought
- **Learning from real work** — pilot evidence, failed validation, and repeated friction can become durable learnings instead of disappearing into chat history

---

## Core concepts

AletheIA keeps a stable core vocabulary so the framework does not get redefined by one tracker, one chat surface, or one runtime.

The most important concepts are:

- **Work Slice** — the bounded unit of operational work
- **Work Item** — the external coordination unit a slice may point to
- **Restart Package** — the compact continuity artifact used after a boundary
- **Handoff** — the transition artifact that carries work across a meaningful boundary
- **Execution Surface** — the local runtime where work happens
- **Agent Role** — the portable semantic responsibility of an agent boundary
- **Runtime Adapter** — the runtime-local mapping that preserves framework meaning

## What is in this repository

The repository is organized around four practical blocks:

1. **framework core**
   - contracts, governance, token discipline, quality, learnings, examples, tests
2. **starter-pack**
   - reusable guides, templates, and practical operating materials
3. **pilot materials**
   - self-application, Crisis Monitor grounding, pilot conversion, project extension
4. **post-1.0 tracks**
   - constrained adoption, resource-aware operations, and later evolution paths

## Current status

AletheIA is now at **1.0.0**.

What 1.0 means:

- the Alpha 1–7 baseline is complete enough for public reuse
- the framework has a stable adoption path
- new work now belongs to **1.x evolution tracks**, not to unfinished baseline buildup

The two most relevant post-1.0 tracks today are:

- **1.1 constrained adoption / trust-boundary hardening**
- **1.2 resource-aware operations**

- `docs/release-1.0-readiness.md`
- `docs/enterprise-readiness-roadmap.md`

1. Clarity over speed
2. Control over automation
3. Consistency over convenience
4. Reuse before duplication
5. Validation before closure
6. Learnings must stay reviewable
