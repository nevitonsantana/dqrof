# AletheIA

**AletheIA** is an operating framework for AI-assisted work.

It helps teams coordinate tasks, context, memory, skills, governance, validation, and learnings **without letting raw model output act directly on the system**.

In simple terms:

`model or agent output -> AletheIA -> execution`

---

## Why the name AletheIA

The name combines **Aletheia** — the idea of truth as something brought into the open rather than left hidden — with **IA**, signaling the framework's focus on AI-assisted work.

Conceptually, the name points to the framework's main intention:

- make reasoning more explicit
- make decisions more reviewable
- make validation and learnings less hidden
- keep AI work from moving straight from output to action without an operating layer

In that sense, AletheIA is not about treating AI output as truth.
It is about creating the conditions for AI-assisted work to become more inspectable, governable, and revealable before execution.

---

## Why AletheIA exists

Many AI workflows still follow a fragile pattern:

`prompt -> output -> execution`

That can be fast, but it is often weak in:

- traceability
- scope control
- policy enforcement
- quality gates
- reusable learnings

AletheIA introduces an explicit operating layer between output and action.

Its goal is not to slow teams down for the sake of ceremony.

Its goal is to make AI-assisted work:

- clearer
- safer
- more predictable
- more reusable across projects

---

## What this is

AletheIA is:

- a framework
- provider-agnostic by design
- focused on safe and explainable AI-assisted work
- built to be reusable across projects
- designed for structured decision-making before execution

AletheIA also keeps a stable canonical vocabulary across trackers, agent surfaces, handoff formats, and runtime-facing records.

See:

- `docs/canonical-vocabulary.md`

## What this is not

AletheIA is not:

- a chatbot
- an app
- a wrapper around a single LLM
- a product-specific toolkit
- a system that assumes automation is always the right answer

---

## Core operating loop

AletheIA works through a controlled loop:

`intent -> context -> decision -> execution -> validation -> learning`

This means the framework helps answer questions such as:

- What exactly is the task?
- What context is truly needed?
- What decision is being made?
- Why is this allowed, blocked, or escalated?
- What validation happened before closure?
- What should be learned from success or failure?

---

## What AletheIA 1.0 proves

AletheIA 1.0 proves that:

- an input can become a structured decision
- governance can block unsafe or poorly framed closure
- failed validation can generate reusable learnings
- the framework can stay small, inspectable, and deterministic
- the core can be reused outside its original pilot project
- pilots can turn into reviewable framework improvements
- handoffs can preserve restartable continuity across boundaries
- structured risk inference can exist as a selective experimental layer rather than universal ceremony
- distribution and delivery can be framed without distorting the core
- the roadmap can distinguish baseline work from post-baseline evolution

---

## Repository structure

- `engine/` — minimal deterministic kernel, governance, and learnings helpers
- `schemas/` — JSON schemas for framework contracts
- `policies/` — governance packs and policy definitions
- `examples/` — canonical examples and golden fixtures
- `tests/` — contract, golden, e2e, and learning-oriented checks
- `starter-pack/` — reusable operating guides, checklists, and templates
- `docs/` — architecture, roadmap, pilot narrative, release-readiness notes, and future-facing delivery boundaries

---

## Initial examples

The repository starts with a few small examples that make the framework tangible:

- `hello-world` — the smallest end-to-end path
- `low-confidence-review` — when ambiguity should stop direct execution
- `high-risk-human-gate` — when risk requires explicit human approval
- `learning-from-failed-validation` — when failed closure should also produce reusable learning
- `governance` — process-oriented rule evaluation using facts and a policy pack

---

## Design principles

1. Clarity over speed
2. Control over automation
3. Consistency over convenience
4. Reuse before duplication
5. Learnings must be reviewable
6. The framework should stay inspectable and debuggable

---

## Current status

This repository is now **AletheIA 1.0.0**.

AletheIA 1.0 includes:

- an Alpha 1 baseline for governance, token discipline, durable decisions, enforcement clarity, quality, and learnings
- an Alpha 2 bridge for self-application, pilot conversion, and project extension, reinforced by real-world Crisis Monitor validation
- an Alpha 3 adoption baseline for getting started, existing-project application, contribution guidance, and starter-pack reuse
- an Alpha 4 handoff baseline for model-agnostic restart packages, project conventions, capture patterns, and stronger multi-boundary continuity
- an Alpha 5 experimental baseline for structured risk inference in higher-risk work, including stronger links to risk-to-gate mapping and iterative maintenance
- an Alpha 6 distribution baseline for presets, adapters, adoption modes, cross-surface delivery mappings, and a constrained adoption example
- an Alpha 7 tooling-boundary baseline for future bootstrap and delivery tooling that remains clearly optional and future-facing
- a current operational-composition baseline for work slices, risk-to-gate mapping, stronger restart-package examples, round-based maintenance guidance, and optional filesystem context-routing experiments

AletheIA 1.0 does **not** claim:

- enterprise-ready rollout by default
- fully tooled bootstrap or delivery automation
- completed domain governance packs

Those remain part of the post-1.0 roadmap.

The first post-1.0 track now starts with enterprise-oriented hardening for constrained and regulated adoption, but still without claiming enterprise-ready packaging by default.
The next queued post-1.0 track is resource-aware operations: a docs-first operationalization lane for observability, proportional context/capability allocation, and advisory runtime/agent fit.
That 1.2 track now begins with telemetry and waste-reading surfaces rather than adapter or learning-layer work.
It now also includes a first docs-first policy-signals layer that turns telemetry and waste patterns into reviewable advisory signals.
The next 1.2 step now begins to define a minimal provider-agnostic runtime adapter contract on top of those surfaces.
It now also adds an advisory runtime/agent decision layer that helps teams reason about over-allocation and under-allocation without introducing auto-routing.
The next 1.2 step now introduces lightweight planning-depth profiles and readiness gates so teams can judge how much structure a slice needs and whether it is healthy to continue.
It now also adds the first bounded Phase F examples so the 1.2 track can compare postures, show constrained/local use, and demonstrate pilot conversion before any benchmark or learning layer.
It now also adds a bounded pilot guide/checklist/template so real-world 1.2 validation can happen before any benchmark or learning-layer escalation.
It now also includes a bounded Crisis Monitor reference so the 1.2 track has one real-world pilot-shaped reading before any benchmark or learning move.
It now also defines the next signals that would justify reopening the track for stronger comparative work instead of growing by inertia.
It now also includes a short 1.2 review so the current scope, proof level, and stop line are explicit.
It now also adds slice finalization and restart guidance so teams can reduce AI Fatigue through compact restart packages instead of transcript replay.
It now also adds a docs-first clean-restart command adapter layer so finalization, clean restart, and resume flows can be exposed through slash-command style adapters without turning AletheIA into a runtime platform.
It now also clarifies how project-local Constitution layers can strengthen governing-context continuity without becoming framework core truth.

## What happens after 1.0

After the 1.0 baseline, the roadmap shifts into **1.x evolution**.

The next planned lanes are:

- **1.1** — enterprise-readiness / constrained adoption hardening
- **1.2** — resource-aware operations
- **1.3+** — benchmark and comparative evaluation
- **1.4+** — learning layer, adaptive orchestration, and later domain governance hardening

Those tracks remain valid, but they are intentionally post-baseline work.
